## My Journey with Elixir
Welcome to my GitHub repository where I document my journey learning Elixir, a dynamic, functional language designed for building scalable and maintainable applications.

Here, you'll find my progress, projects, and insights as I dive into the world of Elixir from a Pythonista with low software skill.

## Why Elixir?
> Elixir stands out due to its excellent concurrency, fault tolerance, and distributed computing capabilities.
> Built on the Erlang VM, Elixir provides the robustness needed for developing scalable and fault-tolerant systems.
> It's widely used in web development, data ingestion, and multimedia processing industries. blah blah blah 

I've always been curious about Elixir and its underlying Erlang VM, intrigued by their reputation for excellent concurrency, fault tolerance, and distributed computing capabilities.

Observing projects and enterprises successfully utilize these technologies only increased my fascination.

Despite my interest, I hesitated to dive in, feeling daunted by the perceived complexity of functional programming.

However, I've decided it's time to challenge myself and explore this robust language. So now, let's go on this learning adventure (born to fail!) !
